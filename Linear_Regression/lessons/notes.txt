* Linear relationship implies some constant straight line relationship

Squared Error - difference between points and line drawn to fit the data

Ordinary Least Squares - minimizes sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function
OLS Theory
    * equation of a straight line: y = mx + b (m is slope, b is intercept with y-axis)
              - in this equation, there is only room for one possible feature x
    * OLS will allow us to solve for the slope (m), and the intercept (b)
