Machine Learning Pathways
collect and store -> clean & organize -> exploratory data analysis -> machine learning models

Raw Data -> Processing and Storing Data = data engineering (collect & store data)
-> Clean & organize data -> exploratory data analysis = data analyst/data scientist. exploratory analysist -> report, visualization, communication
-> machine learning models = data scientist/machine learning engineer

Supervised learning - predict an outcome
Unsupervised learning - discover patterns in data

Unsupervised Learning
    Clustering:
        * Using features, group together data rows into clusters
        * If we have unlabeled data, can we attempt to cluster or group similar data points together to "discover" possible labels for clusters
    Dimensionality Reduction
        * Using features, discover how to combine and reduce into fewer components
        * If we have unlabeled data, can we attempt to reduce the number of features by combining them into new components? Do these new components give us further insight for the data?

Unsupervised Learning ML Pathway
Collect & store data -> Clean and organize data -> exploratory data analysis -> Clustering or Dimensionality Reduction

Questions to keep in mind with clustering: 
    * What does it mean to "discover" labels through clustering?
    * Without known labels, how do we measure performance?
    * Do combinations of features hold important insights?
