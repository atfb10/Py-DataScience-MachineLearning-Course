Machine Learning Pathways
collect and store -> clean & organize -> exploratory data analysis -> machine learning models

Raw Data -> Processing and Storing Data = data engineering (collect & store data)
-> Clean & organize data -> exploratory data analysis = data analyst/data scientist. exploratory analysist -> report, visualization, communication
-> machine learning models = data scientist/machine learning engineer

Supervised learning - predict an outcome
Unsupervised learning - discover patterns in data
