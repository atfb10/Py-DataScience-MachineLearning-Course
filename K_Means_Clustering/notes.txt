Clustering General Concepts
    * Uses unlabeled data & looks ofr similarities between groups in order to attempt to segment the data into seperate labels
    * Use features to decide which points are most similar to other points
    * Do not have label; way to try to "discover the label"
    * It is much harder to compare unsupervised ml algorithms against each other, due to lack of ground truth

Questions
    * How do we assign a new data point to a cluster?
        > depends on unsupervised learning algorithm
        > Use features to assign
    * If we've discovered these new cluster labels, could we use that as a y for supervised training?
        > YES! We can use unsupervised learning to discover possible labels, then apply supervised learning on new data points!
        > NOTE: Clustering doesn't tell you what these new cluster labels represent. No way to know if clusters are still significant
    * How do we determine # of clusters?
    * How can we measure goodness of fit without a y label for comparison?
    * What is ground truth?
