Clustering General Concepts
    * Uses unlabeled data & looks ofr similarities between groups in order to attempt to segment the data into seperate labels
    * Use features to decide which points are most similar to other points
    * Do not have label; way to try to "discover the label"
    * It is much harder to compare unsupervised ml algorithms against each other, due to lack of ground truth

Clustering Questions
    * How do we assign a new data point to a cluster?
        > depends on unsupervised learning algorithm
        > Use features to assign
    * If we've discovered these new cluster labels, could we use that as a y for supervised training?
        > YES! We can use unsupervised learning to discover possible labels, then apply supervised learning on new data points!
        > NOTE: Clustering doesn't tell you what these new cluster labels represent. No way to know if clusters are still significant
    * How do we determine # of clusters?
    * How can we measure goodness of fit without a y label for comparison?
        > Measure the sum of the squared distances from points to cluster centers (How tight the clustering is)
        > Sum should decrease as K increases
        > KEY: We look for a K value where the rate of reduction in SSD (Sum of Squared Distances) begins to decline
            # This signifies that adding an extra cluster is NOT obtaining enough clarity of cluster separation to justify increases in K
            # This is known as the "Elbow" method
            # Can plot this as a line plot
            # Can also plot SSD as barplot
    * What is ground truth?

K Means Clustering General Concepts
    * Must meet following:
        > Each pt must belong to cluster
        > Each pt can only belong to 1 cluster
    * Step 1: Choose # of clusters to create (this is the K value)
    * Step 2: Randomly select K distinct data points
        > We treat these new K points as starting 
    * Step 3: Assign each remaining point to the nearest "cluster" points using a distance metric
    * Step 4: Calculate the center of the cluster points (mean value of each point vector)
    * Step 5: Assign each point to the nearest cluster center
    * Step 6: Repeat steps 4 & 5 until there are no new reassignments!
