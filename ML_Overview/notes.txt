MACHINE LEARNING OVERVIEW

Use library in Python called Scikit learn

Machine Learning - the study of statistical computer algorithms that improve automatically through data
    
    * This means, that apposed to typical computer algorithms which rely on human input for which approach to take, ML algorithms infer best approach from data
    * ML is a subset of AI 
    * ML algorithms are not explicitly programmed on which decisions to make
    * The algorithm is designed to infer from the data the most optimal choices to make

Examples of Problems ML Solves
    * Credit scoring
    * Insurance risk 
    * Price forecasting
    * Spam filtering
    * Customer segmentation 

Structure of ML Problem framing
    * Given features from a data set, obtain a desired label
    * ML Algorithms are often called "estimators" since they are estimating the desired label or output

Majority of ML development time is spent cleaning and organizing data, not implementing the algorithms themselves

Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
    Supervised Learning - Predicting an outcome
        * Using historical and labeled data, the ml model predicts a value
            > historical - known results and data from the past 
            > labeled - the desired output is known
                      - 2 main types 
                            1. Categorical value to predict = classication task
                                Classification task: Cancerous vs. Benign tumour, Fulfilment vs. Credit default, Assigning image recognition (handwriting)
                            2. Continuous value to predict = regression task 
                                Continuous task: Future prices, electricity loads, test scores
    Unsupervised Learning - Discovering a pattern
        * applied to unlabled data the ml model discovers possible patterns in the data
            Example: Clustering customers into seperate groups based on their behaviors
            Challenge: There is no historical correct label. It is harder to evaluate algorithm's performance

Supervised Learning Process
    * Get data 
    * Clean data 
    * Seperate data in features and label
    * Split data into training data and test data set. Use the training set to have the model learn and then see how accurate the model is based on the test data set (most data should fall under training)
    * Evaluate the performance
    * Adjust and then retrain model until happy
    * Deploy model
