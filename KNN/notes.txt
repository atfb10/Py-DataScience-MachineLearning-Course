KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
     - It assigns a label to new data based on the distance between the old data and new data
     - what points is the newest point closest to?
     - K is number of neighbors taken into consideration
     - What if there is a tie? 2 points for class 0 and 2 points for class 1
          * Options:
               > Always choose an odd K 
               > Reduce K by 1 until tie is broken
               > Randomly break tie 
               > Choose nearest class point
          * How SciKit-Learn chooses:
               > The answer will always be the class that happens to appear first in the set of neighbors
               > Results are ordered by distance, so it chooses the class of the closest point
     - How to choose best K value?
          * 2 methods
               1. Elbow Method 
                    > Select K, write down error 
                    > Increase K until error rate increases  
                    > Then decide to continue to increase K value and have more complex model, or stop. (human decision) 
               2. Cross Validate grid search of multiple K values and choose K that results in lowest error (Use this!)
                    > Will result in more complex models 
                    > Have to determine how many k values to consider (contextual question)

KNN General Process 
     1. Choose K value 
     2. Sort feature vectors (N dimensional space) by distance metric
          * Minkowski
          * Euclidean
          * Manhattan
          * Chebyshev
     3. Choose class based on K neaerest feature vectors

KNN Considerations
     * Scaling for distance (features could have vastly different value ranges). SCALING IS NECESSARY FOR KNN!!!
     * Which distance algorithm to use?
     * KNN can be used for regression tasks, but its performance can be poor and is less efficient than other algortithms
     * Completely different than K Means Clustering


SciKit-Learn Pipeline - An object in SciKit-Learn that can set up a sequence of repeated operations; such as a scaler and model 
                      - This means that only the pipleine needs to be called, instead of repeatedly having to call a scaler and model
