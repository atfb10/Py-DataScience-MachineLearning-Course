Notes
    - Seaboarn is a high level abstraction for matplotlib
    - Since it is built off of matplotlib, you can still make plt method calls to directly affect the seaborn plot
    - A typical seaborn plot is one line of code: takes in a dataframe and a corresponding string value for 2 columns of the dataframe
    - Example: sns.scatterplot(x='salary', y='sales', data='df')
