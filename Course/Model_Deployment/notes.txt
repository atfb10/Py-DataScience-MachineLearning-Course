Model Deployment Considerations
    * Choosing a Model
        > Tradeoffs between model interpretability & performance
        > On Sci-Kit Learn documentation check "Choosing the Right Estimator" for a guided map on which algorithms to consider first
    * Purpose of Deployment
        > Small Portfolio Project
            # Consider writing a blog post instead
            # Set up simple API Flask-based website on free tier service like Heroku
        > Enterpriser Level
            # Typically not in the realm of the data scientist who created them :)
    * Performance Expectations
        > Make sure to set clear expectations on model performance based on cross-validation (final hold-out set)
        > DO NOT set expectations on the fully trained model
        > Model Training Workflow:
            a. train/test/validation split
            b. hyperparameter tuning
            c. report results on final holdout set
            d. retrain model on all data prior to deployment!
    * Retraining Models
        > How often should we retrain model on incoming data?
            # Key Considerations
                > Is performance still good?
                > How often are you getting new data
                    $ Size of new data
                    $ New data is labeled
                    $ What percentage of data is used for training
                    $ Example:
                        ^ We have total of 1GB of original training data
                        ^ Receive 1GB of new labeled data a month
