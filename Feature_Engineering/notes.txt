FEATURE ENGINEERING - process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques
    * Extract
        - In general, for most algorithms, data needs to be int of float
        - Example - for a datetime stamp, pull out year, month, etc
        - Example - Text data; length of text, number of times certain terms are used 
    * Combing Information
        - Example Weekend and evening? (Nightlife - 0/1)
    * Transform
        - most algorithms cannot accept string data
        - categorical data is often represented as string data: 2 options
            1. Integer Encoding - transform to numeric data by assigning a category an integer value
                > Possible issue: implied ordering and relationship (ordinal variable)
                > Depends on the context, there could actually be an order... Like climbing grades
                > Only using integer encoding when there is an order
            2. One Hot Encoding (Dummy Variables) - Convert categories into individual features that are either 0 or 1
                > Example: Country columns with country names (pretend 3 countries, Mexico, USA, Canada)
                    # Turns into 3 columns of USA, Mexico & Canado.
                    # The row has a 1 if it that country. A 0 if it is not that country. 
                > This does increase the feature coefficients though...
                    # If possible depending on the context, one can try to reduce feature column expansion by creating hgih level categories 
                        ^ Example, regions or continents instead of countries
                > Can use pandas .map() or apply() to achieve
                > Dummy variable trap: known as multi-collinearity
                    # Converting to dummy variables can cause features to be 
                    # NEVER DO FOR BINARY OPTIONS
                    # DROP one from each category
                        > Example
                > Not easy to add new categories

OUTLIERS - always consider domain
    * Considerations
        > Range 
            # InterQuartile Range
            # Standard Deviation
            # Visualized or domain limit value
        > Percentage of data
            # Few percentage points at most
        > Utilize visualization plots to be able to see and identify outlier points
