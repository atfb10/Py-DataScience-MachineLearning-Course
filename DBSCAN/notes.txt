DBSCAN - Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise
       - Powerful technique for clustering and outlier detection

DBSCAN Key Ideas
    * DBSCAN focuses on using density of points as its main factor for assigning cluster labels
        > Uses density, not distance
    * This creates the ability to find cluster segmentations that other algorithms have difficulty with
        > Example: Cresent Moons 
    * Iterates through points and uses 2 key hyperparameters (epsilon & minimum number of points) to assign cluster labels
        > epsilon: Distance extended from a point
        > minimum number of points: minimum number of points in an epsilon distance

DBSCAN Point Types
    * Core - pt with min. # of points in epsilon range
    * Border - in epsilon range of core point, but does not contain min. # of points
    * Outlier - Cannot be reached by points in a cluster assignment

DBSCAN Procedure:
    * Pick a random point not yet assigned
    * Determine point type
    * Once a core point has been found, add all directly reachable points to the same cluster as core
    * Repeat until all points have been assigned to a cluster or as an outlier
