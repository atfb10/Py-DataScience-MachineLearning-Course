DBSCAN - Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise
       - Powerful technique for clustering and outlier detection

DBSCAN Key Ideas
    * DBSCAN focuses on using density of points as its main factor for assigning cluster labels
        > Uses density, not distance
    * This creates the ability to find cluster segmentations that other algorithms have difficulty with
        > Example: Cresent Moons 
    * Iterates through points and uses 2 key hyperparameters (epsilon & minimum number of points) to assign cluster labels
        > epsilon: Distance extended from a point
        > minimum number of points: minimum number of points in an epsilon distance

DBSCAN Point Types
    * Core - pt with min. # of points in epsilon range
    * Border - in epsilon range of core point, but does not contain min. # of points
    * Outlier - Cannot be reached by points in a cluster assignment

DBSCAN Procedure
    * Pick a random point not yet assigned
    * Determine point type
    * Once a core point has been found, add all directly reachable points to the same cluster as core
    * Repeat until all points have been assigned to a cluster or as an outlier

DBSCAN hyperparameter
    * Key 2:
        1. epsilon - distance extended from a point to a search for a min # of points
            # Increasing epsilon allows more points to be core points which also results in more border points & less outlier points
            # Decreasing reduces core points which also results in less border points & less outlier points
            # Methods for finding epsilon value
                ^ Run multiple DBSCAN models varying epsilon & measure the following:
                    $ Number of clusters 
                    $ Number of outliers
                    $ Percentage of outliers
                ^ KEY: Plot elbow diagram comparing epsilon values
        2. Min number of points - min # of points within epsilon to be a core point
            # Increasing to larger number of samples needed to be considered a core point, causes more points to be considered unique outliers
            # Decreasing to larger number of samples needed to be considered a core point, causes more points to be considered core points
            # How to choose min number of points?
                ^ Test multiple potential values & chart against number of outliers labeled 
            # It can be useful to increase to create potential newe smal clusters instead of complete outliers

        > Changing these two hyperparameters have 2 main outcomes
            1. Changing # of clusters
            2. Changing what is an outlier point
